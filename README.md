# discord-bot
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online communication platforms has increased significantly. Among those platforms, Discord rises as a go-to choice for students and workers of all ages and social classes to communicate because of its interactive and convenient nature. Therefore, I decided to write Discord bots as a way to alleviate the Discord user experience and keep myself sharp before my summer internship.
